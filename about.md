## Kyraha.com

This unique place on the Web you are staring at has been created and is voluntarily supported by Kyraha family (The Owner). Initially this web site was designed as a proving ground for testing new information technologies. It still is though. However that fact doesn't prevent it to exist for the common good. Many projects once started here as an experiment now got their own developers and continue to develop independently.

If you would like to meet our local community - welcome to Sakha Open World. To get more info about Yakutia (Sakha) - try Yakutia Organized. If you're interested in Sakha Language and its appearance on the Net - please check out Orto Doydu
